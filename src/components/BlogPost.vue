      This tutorial will give you a solid starting point for setting up Tailwind in your Vue 3 and Vite project, with an understanding of how to instantly deploy it with Vercel. If you want to directly add and deploy a Vue.js project to Vercel from a template, checkout https://vercel.com/docs#quickstarts . If you want to jump straight to the example, you can view the code here https://github.com/StephDietz/vite-tailwind and the deployed example here https://vue-tailwind-vercel-nu.vercel.app/ .

      Our stack starts with Vue.js, a modern and lightweight javascript framework. Behind the scenes we’ll use Vite, a build tool that aims to provide a faster development experience. We’ll then install Tailwind as our CSS framework, as it integrates seamlessly with Vue, and will make it a breeze for us to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces. We’ll then ship our web app in a few clicks with Vercel!
