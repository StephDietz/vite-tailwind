      In this tutorial, we’ll build a web app from scratch using some of the most cutting-edge and popular frameworks and tools. We make no compromises when it comes to building an amazing product - this includes performance, scale, customizability, and developer experience (making you as efficient as possible)! By the end of this tutorial you will have a solid starting point for your project, whether it’s the next Coinbase or a simple landing page!

      Our stack starts with Vue.js, a modern and lightweight javascript framework. We’ll use Tailwind as our CSS framework because it integrates seamlessly with Vue, and will make it a breeze for us to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces without ever leaving our HTML. We’ll then ship our web app in a few clicks with Vercel! We point Vercel at our web app’s GitHub repo, and as we push commits to the repo’s main branch, Vercel automatically deploys and updates our live website! *So much for dev-ops, with this stack we have super powers!* Behind the scenes we’ll use Vite as our build tool, it provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. We won’t see it much after the initial setup, but rest assured we’re standing on the shoulders of giants.

      This stack is as simple and minimal as they come, but I swear by it, and believe its state of the art around the board. This is how I start any new project, and I’ve arrived at it by constantly upgrading and refining my approach as I’ve built out frontends and products. It’ll take you a long way and serve you well! You can see some examples of other web apps I’ve built with this same stack on my Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8BLoBSZtmVr31UEfCiQfA
